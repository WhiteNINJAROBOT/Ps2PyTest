Im lazy so this is a very trash README but basically, download 'build/app', 'dist' and 'app.spec'.
Then create a new folder and put all 3 in files in the folder.
Next open the dist folder normally and run the exe to start testing.

If you get a 'virus detected' thingy when downloading, contact me via gmail at 'tejaswi.rallabandi@gmail.com' :) 
If you actually think theres a virus, I will walk you through the entire code to explain that there isnt.
